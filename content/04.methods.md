## Methods

### Simulation experiment

### HGSVC

#### (Whole-genome) Simulation

The phasing information in the HGSVC VCF was used to extract two haplotypes for sample HG00514, and 30X pairend-end reads were simulated using vg sim.  The reads were used to call VCFs then compared back to the original HGSVC calls.

When restricting the comparisons to regions not identified as tandem repeats or segmental duplications in the Genome Browser (Table {@tbl:hgsvc-sim-nonrepeat}).
