## Introduction {.page_break_before}

A structural variant (SV) is a genomic mutation involving 50 or more base pairs.
SVs can take several forms such as deletions, insertions, inversions, or translocations.
It is intuitive that their greater size relative to smaller events such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) would imply that SVs can have a larger impact on phenotype.
Indeed, SVs have long been associated with developmental disorders, cancer and other complex diseases and phenotypes[@doi:10.1038/nrg3373], but remain much more poorly studied than their smaller mutational counterparts.
This discrepancy is entirely due to technological limitation: short read sequencing has provided the basis of most modern genome sequencing studies due to its high base-level accuracy and relatively low cost. However, it is poorly suited for discovering SVs, which often lie in repeat-rich regions and whose lengths can far exceed read sizes.
The central obstacle is in mapping short reads to the human reference genome.
It is generally difficult or impossible to unambiguously map a short read if the sample whose genome is being analyzed differs substantially from the reference at the read's location.
If, for example, the read derives from the middle of what would be termed a large insertion relative to the reference, the best result a read mapper could hope to produce would be to leave it unmapped.
In some cases, SVs can be inferred indirectly from short read mappings via split reads, discordant read pairs, or read depth, but the accuracy of such approaches remains limited[@tag:hgsvc].

In practice, large-scale projects have had to combine short read mapping to several other methods to achieve better accuracy.
This methodology has been used to compile catalogs with tens of thousands of SVs in humans[@tag:kgp2015; @tag:gonl].
Recent developments in sequencing technologies and library preparation continue to pave the way for better SV detection.
Several recent studies using long-read or linked-read sequencing have produced large catalogs of structural variation, the majority of which was novel and sequence-resolved[@tag:chaissonCHM; @tag:smrtsv; @doi:10.1038/s41467-017-01343-4; @doi:10.1038/nmeth.4366; @tag:audano2019].
These technologies are also enabling the production of high-quality de novo genome assemblies[@tag:chaissonCHM; @doi:10.1038/nbt.4060], and large blocks of haplotype-resolved sequences[@doi:10.1038/nmeth.4035].
Such technical advances promise to expand the amount of known genomic variation in humans in the near future.
However, their cost prohibits their use in large-scale studies that require hundreds or thousands of samples, such as disease association studies.

At the same time, the reference genome is evolving from a linear reference to a graph-based reference that incorporates known genomic variation[@tag:patenGRrev; @tag:vgnbt; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0316-4].
By including variants in the graph, both read mapping and variant calling become variant-aware and benefit in terms of accuracy and sensitivity[@tag:vgnbt; @tag:bakeoff].
In addition, different variant types are called simultaneously by a unified framework.
vg was the first openly available tool that scaled to multi-gigabase genomes and provides read mapping, variant calling and haplotype modeling[@tag:vgnbt].
In vg, graphs can be built from both variant catalogs in the VCF format or assembly alignment.
Other genome graph implementations have also been used specifically to genotype variants.
Using a sliding-window approach, GraphTyper realigns reads to a graph built from known SNVs and short indels[@tag:graphtyper].
BayesTyper builds graphs with both short variants and SVs, and genotypes variants based on the k-mer distribution of sequencing reads[@tag:bayestyper].
Here again, the graph-based approaches showed clear advantages over standard methods that use the linear reference.

Other SV genotyping approaches typically compare read mapping to the reference genome and to a sequence modified with the SV. 
For example SMRT-SV was designed to genotype SVs identified on PacBio reads[@tag:smrtsv].
SVTyper uses paired-end mapping and split-read mapping information and can genotype deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations[@tag:svtyper].
Delly provides a genotyping feature in addition to its discovery mode and can genotype all types of SVs although the VCF needs special formatting for some[@tag:delly].
SMRT-SV2 is a machine learning tool that was trained to genotype SVs from the alignment of reads to the reference genome augmented with SV-containing sequences as alternate contigs[@tag:audano2019].


We show that the unified variant calling framework implemented in vg is capable of genotyping deletions, insertions and inversions.
We compare vg with state-of-the-art SV genotypers: SVTyper[@tag:svtyper], Delly[@tag:delly], BayesTyper[@tag:bayestyper] and SMRT-SV2[@tag:audano2019].
On simulated variants, vg is robust to small errors in the breakpoint location and outperforms most other methods on shallow sequencing experiments.
Starting from SVs discovered in recent long-read sequencing studies[@tag:audano2019;@tag:hgsvc;@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.25;@doi:10.1101/281006], we evaluated the genotyping accuracy when using simulated or real Illumina reads.
Across all three datasets that we tested, vg is the best performing SV genotyper on real short-read data for all SV types.
Going further, we show that building graphs from the alignment of de novo assemblies leads to better genotyping performance.
